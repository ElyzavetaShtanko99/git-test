sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

Unleash hell, do not repent
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Hold the lines, move as one
In unity our victory's won
new content lines
and here!
another one

something to remove test
--------------------------------

Second bracnh changes

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
